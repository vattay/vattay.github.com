title: Strangely Attracted
---

Time to have some fun. I've been reading a lot about computer security, and really enjoyed [Silence on the Wire](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B008FRNHVY/ref=dp-kindle-redirect?ie=UTF8&btkr=1) by Michal Zalewsji. Since I'm also experimenting with three.js

Turns out the book goes through the 3D visualization of TCP initial sequence numbers, an interesting if somewhat outdated attack on TCP connections. In fact he has a whole [page](http://lcamtuf.coredump.cx/oldtcp/tcpseq.html) on it which is fascinating reading.

Interestingly, although the ISN prediction problem should have been solved long ago, some devices I found still have predictable sequences numbers, especially the Synology NAS.
